test_wcl_resolver.py -- pins WCLResolver, a previously untested new
subsystem found already wired into the project (wcl_resolver.py's
DB_PATH points at wcl_kg/windows_commands_db) with zero test coverage
of its own. Everything here is verified against the REAL shipped
graph, not a synthetic fixture -- same "actually run it" standard as
the rest of this test suite, since a resolver that only passes against
a fake mock graph proves nothing about the real one it ships with.

wcl_kg/pipeline_scripts_reference/README.md is the authoritative
description of the resolution policy this pins:
  1. Exact alias match (single)       -> RESOLVED, no model
  2. Exact alias match (multiple)     -> AMBIGUOUS
  3. SynonymOf 1-hop match (single)   -> RESOLVED, no model
  4. SynonymOf 1-hop match (multiple) -> AMBIGUOUS
  5. Fuzzy alias match (difflib)      -> RESOLVED/AMBIGUOUS, still no model
  6. Abbreviation/full-form variant retry (BETA 0.3.29, only after 1-5
     miss): re-runs 1-5 against known short/long noun substitutions
     (e.g. "net"<->"network", "vm"<->"virtual machine")
  7. Verb...noun bracket match (BETA 0.3.30, only after 1-5 miss): head
     token + tail token bookend the value ("stop the print spooler
     service" -> "stop service" + value "print spooler")
  8. Nothing matches                  -> UNRESOLVED (loose_candidates only)

# resolve() required the ENTIRE query to match a known alias. The moment a
# real value got appended to a realistic phrase ("cat notes.txt", "view
# more notes.txt"), the extra word broke the match and fell straight to
# UNRESOLVED -- meaning the whole slot-filler feature, while correctly
# built and safety-gated, would almost never actually fire on a real
# sentence. This was invisible to the existing test suite because the
# integration test correctly (for testing gating logic in isolation) stubs
# the resolver to always return a fixed result, never exercising whether a
# REAL sentence with a real value actually resolves.

# alias here to catch it, it likely fell through to UNRESOLVED entirely
# instead of finding Restart-NetAdapter. Fixed the same way as the

# variant tried, but ONLY after tiers 1-5 have already failed on the
