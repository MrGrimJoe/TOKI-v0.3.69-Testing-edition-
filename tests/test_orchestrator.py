    from only the intent's generic description, never the actual

      - 'Create a file nmed "python"' dispatched correctly (extractor
        grabbed 'python' from the "" literal) but got narrated as if the
        file were called 'nmed' -- the model was never told the real
        answer.
      - 'now open it' got narrated as opening a specific folder name that
        appeared nowhere in the conversation.
    Fixed by _decision_context() injecting the real value(s) into what
    the model is told, plus _is_narration_grounded()/_fallback_narration()
    as a structural backstop for when a small local model still doesn't

# produces, exactly like tests/test_batch_test_live.py already does for

# ─── BETA 0.3.66 (widget-context merge session): AMBIGUOUS candidates were
# being silently discarded ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Confirmed live: when Tier A (graph_router) misses entirely and
# wcl_resolver.resolve() comes back AMBIGUOUS, process_request() used to
# send the exact same generic "I found a matching command but can't safely
# fill in all its details yet -- try rephrasing it more directly." message
# it sends for a genuinely different situation (a RESOLVED command that
# just needs more detail, e.g. 3+ variables). For AMBIGUOUS, wcl_resolver.py
# had already worked out a concrete list of real candidate commands (name +
# danger_level each) -- discarding that list and telling the user to
# "rephrase" with zero information wasted exactly the disambiguation work
# already done, and became more consequential after this same session's
# wcl_resolver.py fixes started converting some wrong-but-confident
# RESOLVED answers into correct AMBIGUOUS ones as a safety improvement:
# every one of those cases was landing here and vanishing into the same
# content-free reply, with the genuinely destructive candidate never once
# visible to the user.
