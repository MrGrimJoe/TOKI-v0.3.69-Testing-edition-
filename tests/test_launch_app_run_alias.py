test_launch_app_run_alias.py -- BETA 0.3.62: "run <app>" (e.g. "run vscode")
previously didn't route to LAUNCH_APP at all -- neither ACTION_OPEN nor
ACTION_START_PROGRAM in graph_source_data/tier_a_components.py had a bare
"run" alias, despite STATUS.md notes elsewhere claiming "run" should alias
to LAUNCH_APP. Fixed by adding "run" to ACTION_START_PROGRAM. Exercises the
real LayeredGraphRouter (component router first, TF-IDF fallback) against
the actual checked-in toki_graph_db, matching test_graph_router.py's own
skip-if-graph-missing convention.
