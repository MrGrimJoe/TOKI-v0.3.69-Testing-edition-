"""
test_recording_disambiguation.py -- BETA 0.3.49.

The bug: "start recording" used to unconditionally match START_SEEING
(macro capture), silently, even when the person meant dictation ("start
recording what I say"). See extractor.py's looks_like_ambiguous_start_recording()
/ looks_like_ambiguous_stop_recording() docstrings for the full root-cause
story and why a curated keyword table (not another confidence score) is
the right fix here.

Same fixture pattern as test_scheduling_and_conditionals.py's `assistant`
fixture -- see that file's own docstring for why every WindowsAIAssistant()
in a test file needs guaranteed teardown.
