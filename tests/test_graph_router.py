# ─── BETA 0.3.66 (widget-context merge session): CONVERT_SELECTED_FILE ─────
# named-file phrasings -- same gap/fix pattern as KILL_PROCESS's own named-
# app phrasings above: every phrasing before this fix used a generic "this"/
# "this file" pronoun, so "convert notes.txt to markdown" scored 0
# confidence and fell to the search fallback. First attempt at this fix
# used "notes.txt" as the example filename and broke a real, unrelated
# test (test_synonyms.py's "erase notes.txt" -> DELETE_ITEM, which relies
# on "notes.txt" being a novel/high-IDF term) -- caught and fixed by
# switching to "draft.txt"/"summary.txt" instead, confirmed not to collide
# with any other intent's vocabulary anywhere in this file or the test
# suite.
