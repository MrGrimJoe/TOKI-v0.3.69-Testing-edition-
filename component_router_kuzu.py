component_router_kuzu.py -- EXPERIMENTAL router. Same classify() contract
as graph_router.GraphRouter:
    {"intent": "MAKE_FOLDER"}   confident hit
    None                        miss

Unlike the first draft of this experiment, THIS router resolves
candidates with real Cypher queries against the Component/
REQUIRES_COMPONENT/ANY_OF_COMPONENT/FORBIDS_COMPONENT graph built by
build_component_graph.py -- INTENT_COMPONENT_MAP (the Python dict) is
used ONLY to know how many required/any_of components each intent has
(for the specificity tie-break score), not to decide whether a candidate
qualifies. Qualification itself -- "does this intent's required-component
set subset the extracted-component set, does at least one any_of member
appear, does no forbidden member appear" -- is computed by a Cypher
query, executed once per intent (INTENT_COMPONENT_MAP is only iterated to
know WHICH intents to ask the graph about).

Component extraction (text -> {"ACTION_CREATE", "OBJECT_FOLDER", ...})
happens in Python (component_extractor.py) because token matching against
alias lists is a text-processing step, not a graph query -- same division
of labor graph_router.py itself uses (normalize() in Python, phrasing
lookup in Kuzu).

No LLM anywhere. No cosine similarity, no confidence score, no threshold
constant.

        script) OR an already-open kuzu.Database instance.

        The path form is what silently broke this router in every real
        Windows install: orchestrator.py always builds a GraphRouter()
        FIRST (which itself opens toki_graph_db as a kuzu.Database), then
        used to build a SECOND, independent kuzu.Database on that exact
        same directory for this class. Kuzu treats a Database as holding
        an exclusive lock on its directory -- opening two in the same
        process works on Linux (this sandbox), but reliably fails with
        "Could not set lock on file" on Windows. Because the second
        construction was wrapped in orchestrator.py's own fail-open
        try/except, this never crashed anything -- it just silently left
        component_router as None on every single Windows run, making the
        entire component-graph routing layer this file implements dead
        code in production while every test and STATUS.md note assumed
        it was live. Passing the GraphRouter's own already-open .db
        object through instead means there's only ever ONE kuzu.Database
        per graph directory per process -- kuzu.Connection (unlike
        Database) is cheap and safe to open multiple of against the same
